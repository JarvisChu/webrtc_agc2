# webrtc_agc2
demo for webrtc agc2

there may be some problems in the test demo, because the signal after agc2 is not as good as expected. 
- when the amplitude of origin speech is low, there will be a delayed amplification(the speech in the start won't be imporved)
- another problem is when volume of the speech is sometime big and sometime small, the  adaptive effect is not well reflected.
so I share my agc2 demo, so that someone can give me the correct version.
